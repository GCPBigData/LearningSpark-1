# My Spark with Scala Learning Journey
This is my repo to learning-by-doing Spark using Scala.

## My Main Resources
I'm using multiple resources to study and apply what I learn here with examples. This is a list of **main** resources I use (_I will update this list whenever I use a new resource_):

* [Apache Spark 2.0 with Scala - Hands On with Big Data!](https://www.udemy.com/apache-spark-with-scala-hands-on-with-big-data/). Dive right in with 20+ hands-on examples of analyzing large data sets with Apache Spark, on your desktop or on Hadoop! Created by Frank Kane.
